# PredictaCare ‚Äì AI-Driven Risk Prediction Engine for Chronic Care

## üöÄ Project Overview

**PredictaCare** is an advanced AI-powered platform designed to transform chronic care management by shifting healthcare from reactive to proactive patient protection. It predicts the risk of patient deterioration within the next 90 days using a sophisticated **dual-engine hybrid architecture** and provides actionable insights to support clinicians in preventing unplanned readmissions and optimizing care pathways.

## üéØ Key Features

- **Dual-Engine Architecture**
  - **Static Risk Engine** (XGBoost): Processes demographic and clinical baseline features.
  - **Temporal Dynamics Engine** (Transformer): Models irregular time-series patient data using **Clinical Time Encoding** and **Multi-Resolution Attention**.
  - **Fusion Layer**: Combines static and temporal predictions with **attention-weighted ensembling** and performs **uncertainty quantification**.

- **Explainable AI Insights**
  - Global feature importance trends highlight overall risk drivers across the patient population.
  - Local patient-level explanations use **SHAP values** and **Integrated Gradients** to produce clear, clinician-friendly narratives.
  - Counterfactual intervention simulations show how specific actions impact patient risk.

- **Smart Triage Dashboard**
  - Cohort Risk Heatmap visualizing patient risk severity.
  - Interactive patient detail pages showing risk evolution timelines and intervention recommendations.
  - Bulk action tools for efficient task and outreach management.

- **Real-Time Data Integration**
  - Supports real-time data ingestion via **Kafka Streams** and **FHIR R4 APIs**.
  - Combines EHR records, wearables, patient-reported data, and social determinants.

- **Robust Validation & Calibration**
  - Time-aware cross-validation strategy.
  - Hyperparameter optimization via **Optuna**.
  - Calibration using **isotonic regression** and **temperature scaling**.

- **High Impact & Economic Value**
  - Enables proactive clinical decision-making with confidence intervals.
  - Reduces preventable readmissions and optimizes clinician workload.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Multi-modal sources: EHR, wearable devices, social determinants.
   - Streaming pipeline powered by **Apache Kafka**.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Advanced temporal features such as adherence trends, variability metrics, and clinical state evolution.
   - Handles missing data through clinical context-aware imputation.

3. **Prediction Process**
   - Static and temporal engines process input data in parallel.
   - Fusion layer combines outputs with uncertainty quantification.
   - Final output is a 90-day risk probability score with explanations.

4. **Explainability & Intervention Support**
   - SHAP-based global and local explanations.
   - Counterfactual analysis for ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù intervention impact.
   - Confidence intervals quantify prediction certainty.

5. **User Interface**
   - Modern React-based dashboard with Material-UI components.
   - Interactive D3.js visualizations for risk heatmaps and timelines.
   - Mobile-responsive design optimized for clinical use.
